| 8        | Incorporate OpenAI libraries to generate with various prompts from user (location: altitude, temperature, location type, etc; person: age, gender, height, etc) | 8            |

| 5        | Random writing prompt generator that incorporates items from other generators                                                                                   | 10           |
| 4        | Generators branch off from each other (generate person who lives in generated location or object owned by generated person, etc)                                | 8            |
| 3        | Change website theme, changing theme of prompts as well (fantasy/sci-fi/etc)                                                                                    | 10           |
